Findroid is a third-party Android application for Jellyfin that provides a native user interface to browse and play movies and series.

To use this app you must have a Jellyfin server.

You can also download movies and TV shows for offline playback while on the road.
And with the built-in mpv player you are sure that all media formats will play correctly including styled SSA/ASS subtitles.

Thanks for using Findroid!
